 * one thing taken away, and what the assistant prints is a difference between two plans.
 *
 * A ticked wish with a payload row is handed to the engine as an addition, so which one falls out
 * is decided by the visitor's own order (`OptimizeInput.priority`). This is the one place an entry
 * may be removed, and only in front of a list that names it. A wish is fitted when it has a stop
 * that `fits`, never derived from the minute. See
