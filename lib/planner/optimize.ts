 *
 * 1. **Rides that do not fit before the park closes**, in the tiers of {@link OVERFLOW_STRIDE}.
 * 2. **What the day costs**: `cost = Σ wait + IDLE_WEIGHT × Σ idle`, where idle is only the
 *    standing about this file decided on (see {@link idleFor}).
 * 3. **The moment the last queue is left**, only to settle a tie.
 *
 * A ride the optimiser adds is never filed past closing; an entry the visitor already has keeps
 * its overflow block, because deleting their own plan is worse. With `clock`, nothing is planned
 * before now, an entry already under way is fixed, and a walked day is refused. Done entries and
 * free blocks are fixed too: only undone ride entries move.
 *
 * The schedule is contiguous, so the order is the only free variable. The one exception is a
 * deliberate delay, which {@link placementsFor} offers as a Pareto front over (cost, clock). Rope
 * drop is not a special case: it is what minimising the sum produces where the curve says so.
 * A park with no readable wait times has no ordering to prefer ({@link canOptimize}).
